# Portfolio

## Why am I doing this?
As part of the journey to become the best full-stack developer I can be, my journey starts with front-end - <html/> and CSS. This portfolio site is carefully crafted with some bootstrap dependencies. As I progress into the realm of Javascript (where I hope to continue doing vanilla for as long as possible before moving into frameworks like AngularJS, Node.JS), the portfolio site will organically grow both in terms of content and quality. Thanks for visiting, and enjoy! :))

## How am I doing this?
I started with FreeCodeCamp - thanks to @QuincyLarson you're the man - since it's really quite comprehensive and so far have been very enjoyable. The course starts off really basic but then it suddenly gets so deep like an ocean. Just when you're about to drown you see a small life buoy where you have to swim to which are the in-between projects. I'm also doing the Hack Reactor Prep course at the same time while working full-time on top of all this. Hopefully both will give a good point of comparison on how JS works!
