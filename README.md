# Portfolio
## Why am I doing this?
As part of the journey to become the best full-stack developer I can be, my journey starts with front-end - <html/> and CSS. This portfolio site is carefully crafted with some bootstrap dependencies. As I progress into the realm of Javascript (where I hope to continue doing vanilla for as long as possible before moving into frameworks like AngularJS, Node.JS), the portfolio site will organically grow both in terms of content and quality. Thanks for visiting, and enjoy! :)
